### Junior Sunflower 
#### Project Overview

Junior Sunflower is a job board created by students of the ICT program at 42 programming school. This platform is designed for beginners who are just starting their careers and looking for their first job. Unlike LinkedIn, which focuses on experienced professionals, Junior Sunflower helps companies find young talent.

#### Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts: backend and frontend.

Backend (server-side): Built with Python and Django 5. It handles data processing, server logic, and database interactions.
Frontend (user interface): Developed with Vue 3 and TypeScript. This is the interface where users can search for jobs, register for events, create and submit their resumes, and get career coaching.
Features

Job Board: A well-organized job listing with filters for location, job type, and skills.
Career Coaching: Users can get help with resume writing, job search preparation, and interview skills.
Online Job Fairs: Companies can organize real-time events to connect with candidates and discuss job opportunities.
Resume Creation and Management: Users can easily create, manage, and submit resumes directly on the platform.
